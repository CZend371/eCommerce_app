# eCommerce_app
 
# Deployment Link


With the help of a Udemy course I was able to build an eCommerce website called BrewMeister! It is an online store where the user can select to buy from many different craft beer brands. To place an order the user has to sign up first then they are able to add to their cart. Once they have what they want they simply go to checkout and pay for the order. Note that this is a mock storefront so no actual credit card information is needed. Simply use the card number of 4242 4242 4242 4242 then the date can be any future date. The rest of the information can be random numbers. Once the order is placed you will get confirmation that it was successful and the user should receive an email for it as well.
